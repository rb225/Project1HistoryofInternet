    To reach another person on the Internet you have to type an address into your computer -- a name or a number. That address must be unique so computers know where to find each other. ICANN coordinates these unique identifiers across the world. Without that coordination, we wouldn't have one global internet.
    The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) helps coordinate the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions. The IANA functions are critical to the continued operations of the Internet's underlying address book, the Domain Name System (DNS). They include the assignment of technical protocol parameters and the administration of certain responsibilities associated with Internet DNS root zone management.
    ICANN is responsible for Internet Protocol (IP) address space allocation, protocol identifier assignment, and Top-Level Domain name system management. These services were originally performed under U.S. Government contract by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and other entities. ICANN now performs the IANA function. As a private-public partnership, ICANN is dedicated to preserving the operational stability of the Internet.
    ICANN is responsible for coordinating the management of the technical elements of the DNS. Its mission is to ensure universal resolvability so that all users of the Internet can find all valid addresses. It does this by overseeing the distribution of unique technical identifiers used in the Internet's operations.
    Innovation and continuing growth of the Internet bring forth new challenges for maintaining stability. ICANN's President directs an international staff, working from three continents, who ensure that ICANN meets its operational commitment to the Internet community. Advisory Committees from individual user organizations, and technical communities work with the Supporting Organizations to create appropriate and effective policies. Over eighty governments closely advise the Board of Directors via the Governmental Advisory Committee.

    Members of sub-groups in ICANN can raise issues at the grassroots level, rather than the Board of Directors solely declaring what topics ICANN will address. Then, if an issue is worth addressing and falls within ICANN's remit, it can rise through various Advisory Committees and Supporting Organizations until eventually policy recommendations are passed to the Board for a vote.
    ICANN provides an arena where all advocates can discuss Internet policy issues. Almost anyone can join most of ICANN's volunteer Working Groups, assuring broad representation. Process resists capture by any single interest– an important consideration when managing a resource as vital as the global Internet.
    ICANN's belief is that all users of the Internet deserve a say in how it is run. In the ICANN community, you'll find registries, ISPs, intellectual property advocates, commercial and business interests, non-commercial and non-profit interests, and individual Internet users.
    ICANN established market competition for generic domain name (gTLD) registrations resulting in a lowering of domain name costs by 80% and saving consumers and businesses over US$1 billion annually in domain registration fees. The organisation's Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) has been used to resolve more than 5000 disputes over the rights to domain names.

    The Policy Development Support Team (PDT) supports the ICANN community's development of bottom-up, consensus policies and guidelines that help advance the stable and secure operation of the Internet's unique identifier systems. The Policy Staff facilitates the community's formation of policies that are. Developed through a highly participative, fair, and balanced process in a timely and efficient way.
    Reconsideration Request - A request for reconsideration or review of an ICANN action or inaction to the extent that the person or entity has been adversely affected by it. This includes any staff actions or inactions that contradict established ICANN policy(ies) or are taken as a result of the Board's reliance on false or inaccurate material information.
    All Reconsideration Requests must be submitted within 15 days after the date on which information about the challenged Board action is first published in a resolution, unless the posting of the resolution is not accompanied by a rationale. All requests challenging either Board or staff inaction are reviewed and considered by the Board Governance Committee. The BGC may make recommendation to the Board for consideration and action.
    ICANN has determined that the reconsideration process can properly be invoked for challenges to expert determinations rendered by panels formed by third party dispute resolution service providers in the New gTLD Program. The Board shall issue its decision on the recommendation of the BGC within sixty days of receipt of the Reconsideration Request or as soon thereafter as feasible.
    The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) will hand over oversight of the Internet's DNS to ICANN on September 30, 2016. The NTIA has reviewed ICANN's proposal and confirmed that it supports and enhances the multi-stakeholder model for managing the IANA services. The transition to complete ICANN control is scheduled to take place in September 2016.
    The NTIA has confirmed that ICANN has measures in place that will ensure multi-stakeholder control and maintain Internet openness. While concerns are that other countries will have more of an influence on the Internet, the plan is designed with the intentions of avoiding increasing any government's power. There are also concerns over how well ICANN will be able to come to decisions on controversial matters.
    A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS).
    A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that is completely specified with all labels in the hierarchy of the DNS, having no parts omitted. Traditionally a FQDN ends in a dot (.) to denote the top of the DNS tree. Labels in the Domain Name System are case-insensitive, and may therefore be written in any desired capitalization method, but most commonly domain names are written in lowercase in technical contexts.
