                <p class="p1">  The Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), an arm of the U.S Defense Department funded the development
                    of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) in the late 1960s.
                    Its initial purpose was to link computers at Pentagon-funded research institutions over telephone lines.
                    One major obstacle in computer communication was based on the fact, that computers in the 1960s were almost all individual constructions, perfectly fit for the individual purpose of a specific organization or company. There was no such thing as a standard operating system or even a standard way to encode numbers and numerical data. To overcome this difficulty of connecting completely different computer systems all based on different architectures, ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) came up with the
                    idea of establishing a subnetwork with homogeneous communication processors as relays (so called Internet Message Processors,
                    IMPs).

                <p class="p1">
                    ARPANET arose from a desire to share information over great distances without the need for dedicated phone connections between each computer on a network. As it turned out, fulfilling this desire would require packet switching. During its first 10 years, ARPANET was a test bed for networking innovations. New applications and protocols like Telnet,
                    file transfer protocol (FTP), and network control protocol (NCP) were constantly being devised, tested, and deployed on the
                    network.ARPANET was the network that became the basis for the Internet. Based on a concept first published in 1967, ARPANET was developed under the direction of the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).

                <p class="p1">
                    The Interface Message Processor was the packet switching node used to interconnect participant networks to the ARPANET from the late 1960s to 1989.
                    It was the first generation of gateways, which are known today as routers.
                    . The IMP routes the message to the destination host using protocols that were eventually adopted by Internet routers. Messages could store a total length of 8159 bits, of which the first 96 were reserved for the header
                    The interfact message processor proviced an interface to the ARPANET that was independent and could be used by any system. This laid the groundwork for the modern Internet and the network architecture that makes it possible.
                    A contract for the development of IMP was awarded to consulting company Bolt Baranek and Newman in 1968. What they developed essentially consisted of long-distance leased telephone circuits between pairs of IMPs. Host computers were connected to the IMP at the host site and network users were connected to their local host. A set of procols specified the conventions for communication between hosts connected to different IMPs.

                    research and education networks, supported in part by NSF, are connected to the NSFNET backbone — effectively
                    expanding the Internet throughout the United States. The NSFNET was essentially a network of networks that
                    connected academic users along with the ARPANET.The IMP routes the message to the destination host using protocols that were eventually adopted by Internet routers.

                    Tim Berners-Lee proposed the architecture of what became known as the World Wide Web. He created the first web server, web browser, and webpage on his computer at the CERN physics research lab in 1990. In 1991, he announced his creation on the alt.hypertext newsgroup, marking the moment the Web was first made public.
